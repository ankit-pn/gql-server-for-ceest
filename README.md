# Ceest-graphql-server
This project is a GraphQL server implementation for Ceest (Cost-Based Energy Efficient Scheduling in Cloud Computing).

# Central Server 

## Central Server will control every other server that is connected(+authenticated) in real time.

Use of Central Server ---

1. Get total resources, used resources,all details of each virutal machine + task.
2. Add+Schedule new task in most optimal connected server using CEEST algorithm.
3. Scale virtual machines if it result in cost cutting.
4. Virually shut down any of connected server (if there is no task listed in it).
